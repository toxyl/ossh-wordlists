# oSSH wordlists
These lists are updated daily and can be used for internal security scans, username and password policies, intrusion detection, IP reputation decisions, and so on. Feel free to use them for any purpose. If you want to run your own oSSH cluster to collect data like this, check out the [oSSH repo](https://github.com/toxyl/ossh).  

Currently these lists are available:

- passwords.txt: 222091                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Passwords used by bots to login.

Be aware that they can include IPs of VPNs, Tor exit nodes and others that are NOT IPs of the actual attackers. Furthermore, IPs can get reassigned after being recorded by the honeypot. Therefore this list can not be relied upon, but might be helpful as an indicator.
